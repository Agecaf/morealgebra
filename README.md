# Overview

Spire's algebraic types are cool, but we want more standard and complex structures!

That's why we need more algebra!

However, be warned. There's no such a thing as enough algebra.
This is therefore mathematically impossible to be comprehensive.

# Documentation

The Scaladoc documentation is [here](https://agecaf.github.io/morealgebra/).

The tests further provide examples of how to use each structure.

# Contributing

At the moment I cannot guarantee that this project will be maintained.

I might consider channels of communication and/or maintenance later on.

# Copying

This source is mostly(*) released under CC0 (See LICENSE.txt), which means you can freely copy code from /src,
without requiring attribution. It will remain CC0.

(*) Everything I wrote. This excludes LICENSE.txt itself and the /docs directory.

To fork this project,
  - Fork it,
  - Empty the /docs directory (You can regenerate it with `sbt doc`).
  - Delete LICENSE.txt, add your own.

Feel free to "cannibalize" the bits you want into your own library. Actually, I'd be glad if libraries had
more algebraic support.
